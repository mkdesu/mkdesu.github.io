  <h1 class="page-title">Liberté Linux FAQ</h1>
  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How can I trust an anonymity distribution whose source has no verified
credentials?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Liberté Linux is based on
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened">Hardened Gentoo</a>,
which is a well-known and trusted Linux distribution. You are welcome to
download and peruse the source code, and <a href="/liberte-build">build</a>
a live image yourself. Extreme care has been devoted to this ability of users
to build a custom Liberté image on any modern Linux distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: How does Liberté Linux differ from other anonymity distributions?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Liberté is a <a href="/liberte-motivation">specialized</a> and
lightweight live distribution with
<a href="/liberte-security">deep system integration</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mkdesu">rapid development cycle</a>;
it is not a thin configuration wrapper for a major distribution. The focus is
on adding innovative features, some of which require in-house research and
development. A few of the capabilities that (to the best of my knowledge) were
pioneered in Liberté Linux are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/cables">Cables communication</a> for transparent and reliable
anonymous email-like message exchange</li>
  <li>Immediate shutdown with anti-forensic memory erasure on boot media
extraction</li>
  <li>Encrypted persistence of user data and settings on resizable
<a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup">LUKS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeOTFE">OTFE</a>
volume</li>
  <li>Initial clock setting from Tor consensus, entirely dropping the requirement
for non-Tor communication (including DNS)</li>
  <li>Separate <em>Unsafe Browser</em> for registration in public Wi-Fi hotspots</li>
  <li>I2P communication over Tor means better firewall traversal and no need to
rely on another anonymity framework</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of Liberté is not to popularize Tor or I2P with
computer-illiterate users — this distribution assumes willingness and
capability to study operation of non-mainstream operating systems and
software. It is entirely possible that you do not belong to the target
userbase, and that using Liberté (if found) will result in stronger negative
bias from the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why create a lightweight distribution when large-capacity media is
commonly available?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Less code implies less attack vectors, less dispersion of attention
during development, faster integration of upgrades and exploit fixes, better
and faster testing, and more rapid development cycle overall. Lightweight
packages also <em>usually</em> imply less RAM requirements, which matters for older
hardware and for virtual machines. Smaller image allows to optionally load it
into RAM (automatic on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code>), and enables non-disruptive image
verification on boot. There are also more improvement opportunities — e.g.,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">network boot</a> of
a current image is one such possibility. Note that being lightweight does not
necessarily imply lack of features — e.g., Liberté has full
multilingualization, including fonts and UI locales.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: In reference to the <a href="/liberte-logo">logo</a>, is Liberté
distributed by <a href="https://www.4chan.org/">4chan</a>?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence">Illuminati</a>?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a>?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No. Actually, <em>4chan</em> regulars tend to dislike the logo, as anonymity
symbols fell out of fashion with the site community. The logo reflects the
ability to communicate anonymously over the network, and how this ability
empowers the users.</p>

  <p>The <em>Triforce</em> is a powerful artifact from The Legend of Zelda. The
Anonymous does not simply possess it, Anonymous <em>is</em> the Triforce. Freedom of
action, that’s how I deciphered the logotype.
<em>—Anonymous, HiveMind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: I will configure my system to do the same in a week.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: That’s great (and you won’t). In any case, it is not a question.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I install new packages?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Liberté Linux is a deployment-only distribution, so there is no way to
install software into its root tree — both due to lack of toolchain and
portage, and due to <a href="/liberte-security">read-only mode</a> of most
of the filesystem. The only way of adding software is
<a href="/liberte-build">building</a> a custom image, or using portable binaries
(provided that their required libraries are available).</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is it possible to resize the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">OTFE</a> encrypted
virtual partition file?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo otfe-resize</code> from the terminal to grow or shrink the
live partition.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161841/http://freeotfe.org/docs/Main/FAQ.htm#gd">FreeOTFE FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be noted that, although a number of <em>other</em> disk encryption
systems <em>claim</em> to offer volume resizing functionality, they typically carry
out [a full copy to a newly created volume] “behind the scenes” (often failing
completely if insufficient storage is available to hold the new volume) […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above only reflects the complexity of this functionality as perceived by
the authors of FreeOTFE, and is not true for Liberté Linux, which
transparently and reliably resizes the encrypted volume.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I change the OTFE encrypted virtual partition passphrase?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Get a root console (see <em>Troubleshooting</em> in
<a href="/liberte-documentation">Documentation</a>), and run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cryptsetup luksChangeKey /mnt/boot/otfe/liberte.vol
$ rm /mnt/boot/otfe/liberte.vol-hdr.bak
$ cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /mnt/boot/otfe/liberte.vol --header-backup-file /mnt/boot/otfe/liberte.vol-hdr.bak
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Modern flash memory devices with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling">wear leveling</a>
(as well as modern HDDs with automatic bad sectors remapping)
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotsec08/tech/full_papers/czeskis/czeskis_html/">cannot guarantee</a>
that the original OTFE header and its backup have been erased.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: The screen goes blank at some stage of the boot process, or the
brightness is too dark.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Upgrade your BIOS, if possible (it may have buggy ACPI). Try tuning the
brightness up (it may have been reset after video mode change). See <em>video
issues troubleshooting</em> suggestions in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syslinux.cfg</code>. Try the VESA boot
menu option. See also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707054843/http://sourceforge.net/p/liberte/bugs/1">bug #1</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="build">Build</h3>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I would like to go over the emerge messages carefully.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: See <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/portage/emerge.log</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/portage/elog/summary.log</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code>’ed environment.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Does the build process leak build environment information to the final
images?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No, the build environment is sanitized by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enter</code> script, and
some additional precautions are taken as well.</p>
