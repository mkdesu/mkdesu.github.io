  <h1 class="page-title">Security and Anonymity in Liberté Linux</h1>
  <h2 id="boot-security">Boot security</h2>
<p>Liberté was the first Linux distribution to ship with a
<a href="https://www.static.linuxfound.org/sites/main/files/lf_uefi_secure_boot_open_platforms.pdf">Secure Boot</a>-based
trusted boot chain. The trusted chain starts with a KEK / DB CA root, which
can be enrolled into UEFI Secure Boot firmware. The certificate signs GRUB EFI
images (via an embedded intermediate certificate), which verify GRUB
configuration files and the Linux kernel. Initramfs (embedded into kernel
image) then verifies the compressed root filesystem image.</p>

<p>All verification failures are non-fatal, but need to be explicitly
circumvented by the user, who must either disable Secure Boot, confirm
verification failure in GRUB, or exit the debug shell in initramfs — depending
on the chain stage at which the failure occurs.</p>

<p>With regular BIOS-based Syslinux boot, only the last stage (root filesystem
verification) is performed. However, a minimal bootstrap <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code> image
(lacking a compressed root filesystem) is provided, which can be burned to
read-only media and used to boot a regular install of Liberté on writable
media.</p>

<h2 id="operational-security">Operational security</h2>
<p>Liberté Linux maintains persistent storage on an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">OTFE</a>
volume accessible via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/persist</code> — a virtual partition file that is located
on the boot media where Liberté is installed. This volume uses AES-256 cipher
in XTS block mode, with SHA-512 header hashing. It is best to store all
documents on this OTFE volume. In addition, Liberté provides automatic
on-demand mounting of permanent and removable media at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/media</code>. You are
advised to employ extreme care when writing to such non-encrypted media.
Specifically, it is recommended to avoid writing to the non-encrypted parts of
the boot media, especially since the OTFE partition is fully resizable with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo otfe-resize</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> / <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpa/">GPA</a>
are installed for explicit file encryption tasks. You are advised to keep the
following rough key sizes correspondence in mind when working with keys:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symmetric encryption</th>
      <th>Asymmetric encryption/signing</th>
      <th>Asymmetric signing digest</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AES-128</td>
      <td>RSA/DSA/ELG-3072</td>
      <td>SHA-256</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AES-192</td>
      <td>RSA/DSA/ELG-7680</td>
      <td>SHA-384</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AES-256</td>
      <td>RSA/DSA/ELG-15360</td>
      <td>SHA-512</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Key-Management/key-management-guidelines">NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, §5.6.1</a></p>

<p>Note that GnuPG tries very hard to <em>not</em> let you do what you want, especially
w.r.t. limiting the generated asymmetric key size and the availability of
asymmetric encryption algorithms. In this regard, GnuPG attempts to be a
“software solution” like many Windows applications — but it is a
non-interoperable <em>command-line</em> “solution” with many parameter switches. You
might therefore consider evaluating other options, depending on your
cryptographic needs.</p>

<h2 id="network-security">Network security</h2>
<p>Liberté explicitly configures selected applications and services to use Tor
via its local proxy (where access to the proxy is additionally vetted), thus
forcing applications to create connections to the proxy on the loopback
interface (localhost).
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/home-router-howto.xml">Netfilter IP firewall</a>
then realizes a default-deny policy on both incoming and outgoing external
connections. An inadvertently leaked IP address or a direct connection attempt
do not pose a problem with this approach. The only exception to this in
Liberté is <a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a>, whose peer connections are
transparently routed via Tor, because I2P does not support using proxies for
this purpose, and because other methods (like dynamic library socksification)
fail. Since I2P communication is visible to Tor exit nodes, this might pose a
problem — however, I2P has been verified to not leak the system’s IP address
when used in hidden mode.</p>

<p>The following external traffic is explicitly allowed on the firewall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DHCP, and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> external communication to
HTTP(S) ports (no DNS is used)</li>
  <li>Rate-limited ping reply, the only possible response to uninitiated inbound
traffic</li>
  <li>User-created VPN connections to relevant ports (servers must be specified as
IPs, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tor-resolve</code>)</li>
  <li>Unsafe Browser’s external communication (including DNS) for wireless
hotspots registration</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> communicates with peers via Tor,
providing additional anonymity, and enabling I2P to be used in most firewalled
environments.</p>

<p>Loopback interface connections are also partially restricted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only Tor and <a href="https://geti2p.net/">I2P</a> can locally connect to the hidden
service daemon</li>
  <li>Only main user and <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> can locally connect to
Tor and I2P</li>
  <li>Only main user, cables daemon and <a href="https://www.vervest.org/htp/">HTP</a> can
locally connect to Privoxy</li>
</ul>

<p>Some additional IPv4 protection is afforded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysctl</code> kernel parameters.</p>

<p>DHCP transmissions are
<a href="https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/">locked down</a>:
hostname transmittal, identification, ARP, and IPv4LL are disabled.</p>

<p>NTP is the only application that potentially must communicate in the clear —
to a known <a href="https://www.ntppool.org/">server pool</a>. NTP is not necessary
for correct operation of Liberté, and it is currently turned off to prevent
timestamp-based fingerprinting and MIM DoS attacks. Torified HTP adjusts the
time very reliably — albeit with less precision. In general, Tor requires a
correct computer clock to start up, but in Liberté this problem is
circumvented using a consensus-based time estimate.</p>

<p>In order to connect to many wireless networks, a web login via transparently
rerouted connection is required. Liberté allows to run a browser as a
specially designated user, for which DNS access and network traffic to common
wireless web registration ports are not filtered. To enhance Wi-Fi privacy,
MAC addresses of wireless interfaces are randomized during boot.</p>

<h2 id="system-security">System security</h2>
<p>Upon boot, the system is locked down by disabling the default root password
(which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">liberte</code>). Other accounts, including the main user, do not have a
password. Also, most daemons drop superuser privileges immediately after
starting, including Tor, I2P, Privoxy, NTP, HTP, D-Bus, nscd, PC/SC, and
cables daemon. The root console (accessible when the X server is down) is
still available for 2 minutes after boot for troubleshooting and other
purposes. You can restore the password by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usermod -U root</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passwd</code>, and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">su</code> to root elsewhere. Alternatively, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gentoo=root</code>
boot menu option has the same effect. Most of the root filesystem is
read-only, and only selected directories are writable.</p>

<p>All the installed software is compiled with the
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Toolchain">Hardened Gentoo toolchain</a>,
which affords automatic protection against stack smashing attacks (SSP) and
enables application address space layout randomization (ASLR) in the hardened
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaX">PaX</a> kernel.
<a href="https://grsecurity.net/">Grsecurity</a> is also enabled.</p>

<p>An abrupt extraction of the removable boot device results in immediate RAM
wipe and power-off. Upon normal reboot / shutdown sequences, RAM is also wiped
to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot attacks</a>.
Maximal RAM-clearing range is achieved by allocating memory after a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kexec">kexec</a>-based boot with a minimal
kernel.</p>

<p>In X server environment, screen can be locked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Win-L</code> key sequence, or
via panel menu. When the screen is locked, a logo image covers the whole
screen, and mouse / keyboard are grabbed until the correct password is
entered, followed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code> key (during the first lock attempt, the
user is queried for a password, and its hash is retained in the persistent
storage). The <em>VT Switch</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl-Alt-F*</code>) and <em>Zap</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl-Alt-Bksp</code>) key
sequences are permanently disabled in X server configuration, <em>SysRq</em>
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysRq-*</code>) kernel interaction key sequences are disabled, and ACPI
power-off events are ignored until the screen is unlocked. Any tray
notification events are similarly delayed.</p>

<h2 id="build-and-release-security">Build and release security</h2>
<p>Liberté Linux releases are signed with a designated PGP key (DSA-3072). During
the build process, all downloaded files are automatically verified:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial Gentoo snapshots are verified against their
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:RelEng#Release_security_and_signing">PGP signatures</a>
(portage: RSA-4096) and signed checksums (stage3: RSA-4096, MD5 + SHA-1)</li>
  <li>Kernel patches are verified against their respective checksums (SHA-256)</li>
  <li>During incremental builds, Gentoo portage tree is updated using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emerge-webrsync</code>, which verifies snapshots against their PGP signatures
(RSA-4096); <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> is not used  since it lacks the verification mechanism</li>
  <li>Individual downloaded packages are verified against checksums (RMD-160 +
SHA-1 + SHA-256) that are kept in the previously verified Gentoo portage tree</li>
  <li>Custom ebuilds afford the same verification procedure as the ebuilds in
portage</li>
</ul>

<p>The fingerprints for all downloaded signing keys, as well as the kernel
patches checksums, are located in the Liberté source tree.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Currently, updates of
<a href="https://www.smartmontools.org/">SMART drives</a> and
<a href="https://geti2p.net/en/faq#subscriptions">I2P hosts</a> lists are not verified,
since the corresponding released updates are not signed. Instead, the
structure of these lists is verified with regular expressions after each
update. The <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/faq#manual_reseed">I2P netDb</a> router info
files supplied with Liberté are analyzed using I2P’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net.i2p.data.RouterInfo</code> utility.</p>
